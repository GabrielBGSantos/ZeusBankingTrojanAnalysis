# ZeusBankingTrojanAnalysis
A minucial analysis of the famous Zeus Banking Trojan

The Zeus malware was first spotted in 2007 after it was caught stealing sensitive information from the US Department of Transportation systems. The malware uses web injects, form grabbing, keylogging, and other functionalities to steal credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), and ultimately money from its victims (zeusmuseum.com).

In this project, I provided an analysis of this malware with the objective of learning more about how malware works and how to detect it on our systems.
